# Networking

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this activity, you should be able to:
- Understand the basic concepts of networking, including IP addresses, subnets, and routing.
- Configure network interfaces using command-line tools such as ifconfig, ip, and netplan.
- Understand how to configure network settings such as DNS, gateways, and routing tables.
- Troubleshoot network connectivity issues using tools such as ping, traceroute, and netstat.
- Implement security best practices such as configuring firewalls, securing network services, and monitoring network traffic.

### Estimated Time: 3 hours

## Introduction
In the context of Linux operating systems, networking refers to the ability of the system to connect to and communicate with other devices over a network. This can include connecting to the internet, connecting to other computers or devices on a local area network (LAN), or setting up a network connection to share resources such as files or printers. Networking in Linux is typically accomplished through the use of various networking tools and protocols, such as TCP/IP, SSH, and FTP.

## Why is it important to know?
- Networking is critical to establishing connectivity between devices on a network. Understanding the concepts of networking in Linux, such as IP addresses, subnets, and routing, is essential for establishing and maintaining connectivity.
- Configuring network interfaces, settings, and services is a core aspect of Linux system administration. Proper network configuration ensures that devices on the network can communicate with each other effectively and efficiently.
- Network issues can be complex and require a thorough understanding of networking concepts and tools to troubleshoot effectively. Knowledge of networking in Linux is essential for identifying and resolving connectivity issues and other network-related problems.
- Networking can be a significant security risk if not configured and managed properly. Understanding how to configure firewalls, secure network services, and monitor network traffic is crucial for ensuring the security of a Linux network.
- Networking is a fundamental skill in IT, and proficiency in Linux networking can enhance job prospects and professional development opportunities.
