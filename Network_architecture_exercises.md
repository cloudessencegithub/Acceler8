You are tasked with designing an AWS VPC architecture for a company's cloud infrastructure. The company has the following requirements:

The VPC should be able to host multiple web applications, each with public-facing and private components.
The web applications should be highly available and scalable, with the ability to handle high traffic loads.
The architecture should have strong security measures in place to protect the applications and data.
The company wants to connect its on-premises data center to the VPC securely.
The architecture should be cost-efficient and optimize resource utilization.
