# Network Architecture -  AWS VPC
AWS VPC (Amazon Virtual Private Cloud) is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to create a virtual network in the cloud. It enables you to define and control a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, databases, and load balancers.

## WHhy its important
Amazon VPC enables you to connect your on-premises resources to AWS infrastructure through a virtual private network. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your data center but enables you to leverage the scalable infrastructure in AWS. 

Each VPC that you create is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS cloud and is fully customizable. You can select the IP address range, create subnets, configure root tables, set up network gateways, define security settings using security groups, and network access control lists.
