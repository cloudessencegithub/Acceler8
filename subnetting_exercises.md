# Subnetting

## Learning Objectives
- How to subnet 
- Evaluate your understanding of subnets

### Estimated Time: 1 hour


### Instructions
Exercise 1:
Assume you have a network with three subnets: Subnet A, Subnet B, and Subnet C. Subnet A has an IP address range of 192.168.1.0/24, Subnet B has an IP address range of 192.168.2.0/24, and Subnet C has an IP address range of 192.168.3.0/24. Determine the subnet mask for each subnet.

Exercise 2:
You have been assigned the network address 192.168.0.0/24 and need to create multiple subnets to accommodate different departments in your organization. The requirements are as follows:

Subnet A should have a minimum of 60 host addresses.
Subnet B should have a minimum of 30 host addresses.
Subnet C should have a minimum of 10 host addresses.
Reserve one subnet for future use.
Determine the subnet masks and subnet ranges for each of the subnets that satisfy the given requirements.

Exercise 3:
You have been given the IP address 172.16.0.0/20. Determine the number of subnets and the number of host addresses available in each subnet.

Exercise 4:
You have a network with the IP address 192.168.10.0/24. You need to create multiple subnets, each accommodating 20 host addresses. How many subnets can you create, and what would be the subnet mask for each subnet?
