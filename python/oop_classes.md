# OOP, Classes, and Inheritance


## Learning Objectives
- A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, which are instances of the class. Learning objectives include creating classes and objects, defining class methods and attributes, and understanding how to access and manipulate object data.
- Inheritance is a mechanism in which a subclass can inherit the properties and methods of a superclass. Learning objectives include understanding inheritance, creating subclasses and superclasses, and using inheritance to extend and reuse existing code.
- Object-oriented design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. Learning objectives include understanding common design patterns, such as the Singleton pattern and the Factory pattern, and knowing when and how to apply them in software design.


### Estimated Time: 1 week

## Introduction
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and their interactions to design applications and computer programs.
A class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). An object is an instance of a class and can be created using the class name followed by parentheses.
Inheritance is a mechanism for code reuse and for expressing a class relationship. It allows a new class to be derived from an existing class, inheriting all of its attributes and methods. The derived class can also have additional attributes and methods, or override the ones inherited from the base class.
Using classes and objects, OOP allows to organize and structure code in a clear, modular and maintainable way. Also, it allows to create reusable functions, which makes code more efficient and easy to test and debug.


## Why is it important to know?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on organizing software as a collection of objects that interact with each other. OOP provides a way of structuring code that is modular, reusable, and easy to maintain. The key concepts of OOP are classes and inheritance.
Here are some reasons why it is important to learn OOP, classes, and inheritance:
- Modularity: OOP allows you to write code that is modular, which means you can break down your code into smaller, more manageable parts. This makes it easier to maintain and update your code over time.
- Reusability: OOP allows you to reuse code by creating classes that can be used in different parts of your program. This saves time and effort, as you can use the same code to perform different tasks.
- Encapsulation: OOP provides a way to encapsulate data and behavior into a single entity called a class. This helps to keep your code organized and prevents unintended changes to your code.
- Abstraction: OOP provides a way to abstract complex systems into simpler, more manageable parts. This allows you to focus on the big picture and ignore the details.
- Inheritance: Inheritance is a powerful feature of OOP that allows you to create new classes that are based on existing classes. This saves time and effort, as you can reuse code from existing classes and extend their functionality.
