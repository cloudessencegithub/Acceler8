# Data Types

## Learning Objectives
The learning objectives of data types include:
- Students should be able to define what data types are and how they are used in programming.
- Students should be able to recognize the different data types such as integers, floats, strings, booleans, etc. and know how to use them in programming.
- Understand the limitations of different data types
- Students should be able to apply their knowledge of data types to write code that performs calculations and manipulates data.
- Students should be able to identify and fix common errors related to data types, such as type mismatch errors.
- Create and using user-defined data types


### Estimated Time: 1 week

## Introduction
In Python, a data type is a category of values that can be stored and manipulated in a program. The built-in data types in Python include:
Numeric types: these include integer (int), floating-point (float), and complex (complex) types.
Sequences: these include strings (str), lists (list), and tuples (tuple).
Mappings: these include dictionaries (dict).
Sets: these include set (set)
Booleans: these include the built-in constants True and False
None type: It is special data type represent a null or no value
These data types define the operations that can be performed on their values, and the amount of memory that is required to store those values.


## Why is it important to know?
Learning about data types is important because it helps you understand how computers store and manipulate different types of data. When working with data, it is important to know the data type in order to perform operations on it correctly and efficiently.
Here are some specific reasons why learning about data types is important:
- Memory management: Different data types require different amounts of memory to store. Understanding data types can help you optimize your code by minimizing the amount of memory your program uses.
- Type checking: When programming, you need to make sure that the operations you perform on your data are valid. Data types help you ensure that you're performing the right operations on the right type of data.
- Input validation: When accepting input from users or external sources, it is important to validate that the input is in the correct format and type. Understanding data types helps you perform this validation correctly.
- Compatibility: Different programming languages and systems have different data types. Understanding data types can help you ensure compatibility between different systems and prevent errors when communicating or sharing data.
