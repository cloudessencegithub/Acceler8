# DNS
DNS, or the Domain Name System, translates human readable domain names (for example, www.amazon.com) to machine readable IP addresses (for example, 192.0.2.44).

## Why it't important to know

Human-Readable Naming: DNS allows us to use human-readable domain names (e.g., google.com) instead of remembering and typing complex IP addresses (e.g., 216.58.214.46). This makes it easier for users to access websites, services, and resources on the internet.

Translates Domain Names to IP Addresses: DNS translates domain names to their corresponding IP addresses, which are required for establishing connections and routing data over the internet. It enables communication between devices and allows users to access websites and other online services by simply typing a domain name.

Internet Navigation: DNS forms the backbone of internet navigation. It enables users to navigate the web by clicking on hyperlinks or entering domain names in web browsers. DNS resolution ensures that users are directed to the correct IP addresses associated with the requested domain names.

Load Balancing and Traffic Distribution: DNS plays a vital role in load balancing and distributing network traffic across multiple servers or data centers. By configuring DNS records with multiple IP addresses for a domain, DNS can distribute incoming requests among the available resources, optimizing performance and preventing overloading of specific servers.

High Availability and Redundancy: DNS supports high availability and redundancy by allowing the configuration of multiple IP addresses for a domain name. In case one server or IP address becomes unavailable, DNS can automatically route traffic to an alternative IP address, ensuring uninterrupted access to resources.
