# Shell Scripting

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this activity, you should be able to:

- Understand the basic concepts of shell scripting, including variables, control structures, and functions.
- Write basic shell scripts using bash or other commonly used shells.
- Use control structures such as if-else statements and loops to create more complex scripts.
- Understand how to use command-line arguments to pass parameters to a shell script.
- Understand how to work with files and directories using shell scripts.
- Understand how to use regular expressions and text processing tools in shell scripts.
- Understand how to use shell scripts to automate common system administration tasks.

### Estimated Time: 4 hours
Shell scripting is a way to automate tasks in Linux by writing scripts, or sequences of commands, that are executed by the shell (a command-line interpreter). Shell scripts are useful for automating repetitive tasks, setting up and maintaining systems, and performing administrative functions. A shell script is typically created by writing a series of commands in a text file, which is then executed by the shell. Shell scripts can be written in different shell languages, such as bash, csh, and ksh, and can include a variety of commands, including built-in shell commands, commands invoked from external programs, and control structures such as loops and conditional statements.

## Why is it important to know?
- Shell scripting allows you to automate tasks and reduce the amount of manual work required to perform system administration tasks. This can save time and reduce errors.
- Shell scripts can be customized to fit the specific needs of a system or environment. This can help you tailor your Linux system to meet the unique needs of your organization.
- Shell scripts can be used to perform tasks quickly and efficiently. This is especially important when dealing with large systems or complex tasks.
- Shell scripting is a foundational skill for learning other scripting languages like Python or Perl, which are widely used for automation, web development, and data analysis.
- Shell scripting skills can help you debug and test scripts more efficiently, which is crucial for ensuring that your scripts work as intended and don't cause issues on your system.
