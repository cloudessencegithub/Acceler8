# File hanfling with Python
File handling is an important part of any web application.
Python has several functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting files.
Variables are a fine way to store data while your program is running, but if you want your data to persist even after your program has finished, you need to save it to a file. You can think of a fileâ€™s contents as a single string value, potentially gigabytes in size. In this chapter, you will learn how to use Python to create, read, and save files on the hard drive.
## Learning Objectives
1. Create files and directories
2. Delete files and directories
3. Overwrite files
4. Append to a file
5. Manipulate the content of a file

## Why it't important to know
Learning file handling in Python is essential because it allows you to work with files, read data from them, write data to them, and manipulate their contents. Here are some reasons why learning file handling in Python is valuable:

Data Persistence: Files provide a means to store data persistently. With file handling in Python, you can read data from external files (such as text files, CSV files, or JSON files), process the data, and store the results back in files. This is crucial for tasks involving data analysis, data processing, and working with large datasets.

Data Input and Output: File handling enables reading input data from files and writing output data to files. You can interact with users by reading data from files, performing calculations or operations, and writing the results back to files. This facilitates creating programs that process batch data or handle large volumes of information.

File Manipulation: Python's file handling capabilities allow you to create, delete, rename, and modify files. You can create directories, move files across directories, or manipulate the file system structure programmatically. This is useful when building file management tools or automating file-related tasks.

Configuration and Settings: Files often serve as a means to store configuration settings or preferences. Python's file handling allows you to read configuration files, extract relevant information, and configure your application or script accordingly. This makes it easier to create flexible and customizable applications.

Data Serialization: File handling plays a vital role in data serialization, which involves converting complex data structures into a format suitable for storage or transmission. Python provides modules like pickle and json that allow you to serialize Python objects into files and deserialize them back into memory.

File System Operations: Python's file handling capabilities extend beyond individual files. You can work with directories, perform file searches, iterate through files in a directory, and perform operations on multiple files simultaneously. This helps with tasks such as batch processing, data cleanup, or organizing large collections of files.

Integration with External Systems: Files are a common medium for data exchange and integration between different systems. By learning file handling in Python, you can interact with external systems, read or write data to specific file formats, and seamlessly integrate your Python programs with other applications or services.
