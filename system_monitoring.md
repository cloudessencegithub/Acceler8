# System Monitoring

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this activity, you should be able to:

- Understand the importance of system monitoring and its role in maintaining system stability and performance.
- Understand the different types of system metrics that can be monitored, including CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and network traffic.
- Understand the tools and commands available for monitoring system metrics, such as top, htop, vmstat, iostat, netstat, and iftop.
- Understand how to use performance monitoring tools like perf and strace to identify and troubleshoot performance issues.
- Understand how to set up and use system monitoring solutions like Nagios and Zabbix to monitor system health and availability.
- Understand how to configure and use system logging to capture performance and resource utilization data.
- Understand best practices for system monitoring, including setting up alerts and notifications, analyzing monitoring data, and tuning system performance based on monitoring results.

### Estimated Time: 2 hours

## Introduction
System monitoring in Linux refers to the process of keeping track of various aspects of the system's performance and resource usage. This includes monitoring things such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, network traffic, and process activity. System monitoring is an important aspect of system administration, as it allows administrators to ensure that the system is running efficiently and effectively, and to identify and troubleshoot problems when they occur. In Linux, system monitoring is typically accomplished using various tools and utilities, such as “top”, “vmstat”, “iostat”, and “sar”, which allow administrators to view real-time and historical performance data. System monitoring can be performed manually by an administrator, or it can be automated using monitoring software.

## Why is it important to know?
- System monitoring tools can help identify performance issues like high CPU usage, memory usage, or disk I/O, which can be bottlenecks that slow down the system.
- By monitoring system metrics, administrators can identify potential system issues and use troubleshooting tools to determine their root cause and take corrective action.
- System monitoring can help detect and prevent system downtime by alerting administrators to potential problems before they escalate.
- Monitoring system metrics can help administrators optimize resource utilization, ensuring that resources like CPU, memory, and disk space are used efficiently and effectively.
- System monitoring can help detect security threats and attacks by monitoring network traffic, system logs, and other security-related metrics.
- By monitoring system metrics over time, administrators can identify trends and plan for future growth, ensuring that the system can scale to meet evolving business needs.
