### Estimated Time: 1 hour


### Instructions

Exercise 1:
Consider the following IP address: 192.168.0.1. Identify the class of the IP address and calculate the default subnet mask for this class.

Exercise 2:
Suppose you have a computer with an IP address of 10.0.0.5 and a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. Determine the network address, broadcast address, and the range of valid host addresses for this subnet.

Exercise 3:
You need to establish a TCP connection between a client and a server. The server's IP address is 192.168.1.10, and it's listening on port 8080. Write a command or code snippet in your preferred programming language to initiate the connection.
