# Process Management

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Understand the concepts and principles of process management in Linux system, including process creation, monitoring, and termination
- Understand process priorities and signals.
- Use the appropriate command line tools to manage processes on different Linux distributions, and evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of different process management systems.
- Finally, they will learn about the role of the init system and its variants in process management, and how to configure and use them effectively.

### Estimated Time: 2 hours

## Introduction
Process management is the set of activities that a computer system performs in order to manage the execution of processes. A process is a program that is running on a computer, and process management is responsible for creating, scheduling, and terminating processes, as well as allocating resources to them. Process management is an important part of the operating system, and it is responsible for ensuring that the computer is able to run multiple processes concurrently and efficiently

## Why is it important to know?
- Understanding process management allows users to monitor and optimize the usage of system resources such as CPU, memory, and disk space, by identifying and terminating unnecessary or malfunctioning processes.
- Knowledge of process management helps users to ensure the stability and reliability of their system by monitoring and responding to system performance issues and errors caused by misbehaving or malfunctioning processes.
- Familiarity with process management allows users to manage and prioritize their running processes effectively, and to optimize system performance for their specific use case, which can significantly increase their productivity.
- Understanding process management helps users to identify and troubleshoot issues related to system performance and errors, and to resolve these issues using the appropriate tools and techniques.
- Knowledge of process management allows users to control access to system resources and processes, and to monitor and prevent unauthorized access or misuse of these resources.
