- Build a CloudWatch Dashboard that contains several widgets like graphs and alarm statuses that can help in visualizing and monitoring different aspects of your AWS infrastructure.
- Create a CloudWatch Events rule that triggers a Lambda function when a specific AWS API call is made (such as launching or terminating an EC2 instance).
