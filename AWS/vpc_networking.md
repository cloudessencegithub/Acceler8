### Estimated Time: 3 weeks

## Introduction
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

## Why is it important to know?
- Security: VPC networking allows you to control inbound and outbound network traffic to your AWS resources. It helps to set up security groups, network access control lists (ACLs), and VPC Flow Logs for monitoring traffic. Understanding these controls is essential for maintaining a secure AWS environment.
- Performance: By setting up your network correctly, you can optimize the performance of your applications. For example, you might configure routing to maximize network speed or ensure that traffic between services stays within your VPC for cost and performance reasons.
- Isolation: VPCs enable you to isolate your AWS resources from the public internet and from each other. This can be important for separating different environments (like development, staging, and production) or different parts of an application.
- Scalability: As your infrastructure grows, you might need to connect multiple VPCs or combine on-premises networking with your AWS environment via a VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Understanding VPC networking will be critical to making these changes effectively.
