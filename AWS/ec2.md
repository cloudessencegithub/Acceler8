### Estimated Time: 3 weeks

## Introduction
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.

## Why is it important to know?
- Scalability: One of the primary advantages of EC2 is the ability to scale your infrastructure according to the need. You can easily start with a single small EC2 instance and grow to thousands of instances as your traffic or workload increases.
- Flexibility: With EC2, you have access to various instance types optimized to fit different use cases. EC2 instances can be customized to suit any workload, from small applications to large machine learning tasks.
- Cost-Effective: AWS EC2 offers multiple pricing options. You can choose from On-Demand instances (pay for what you use), Reserved Instances (commit to EC2 over 1-3 years and in turn receive a significant discount), Spot Instances (bid on spare computing capacity), and Dedicated Hosts (physical EC2 servers dedicated for your use). Understanding EC2 allows for effective cost management.
