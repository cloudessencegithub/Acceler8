## Introduction
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. IAM enables you to create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources.

IAM is a key component of AWS security. It allows you to control who can access your AWS resources and what actions they can perform on those resources. IAM also enables you to grant permissions to users and groups based on their roles and responsibilities within your organization.
