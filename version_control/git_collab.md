# Github collaboration

## Learning Objectives
- Learn how to work with Git and version control concepts such as commits, branches, and pull requests.
- Learn how to create and merge pull requests, review code changes, and resolve conflicts.
- Managing issues and projects: GitHub has built-in tools for managing issues and projects. You will learn how to create and assign issues, track progress using milestones, and manage projects using boards.
- Working with open source software: GitHub is a popular platform for open source software development. By contributing to open source projects on GitHub, you can learn how to work with a large codebase, collaborate with a distributed team, and participate in the open source community.
- Continuous integration and deployment: GitHub can integrate with a variety of continuous integration and deployment tools, such as Travis CI and CircleCI. You will learn how to automate the testing and deployment of your code using these tools.


### Estimated Time: 1 week

## Introduction
GitHub is a web-based platform that enables collaborative software development using the Git version control system. It allows developers to store their code in repositories and track changes made to the code over time. GitHub's collaboration features are particularly useful for teams of developers who are working together on a project.

## Why is it important to know?
- GitHub is a popular platform for collaborative software development. It allows multiple developers to work together on the same project simultaneously, making it easier to manage complex projects and speed up the development process.
- GitHub provides version control for software development projects, which helps developers track changes to code and collaborate more effectively. It makes it easier to revert to previous versions if there are issues with the current version.
- GitHub provides a platform for code review, which allows developers to review each other's code and provide feedback. This helps ensure that the code is high quality and meets the project's requirements.
- GitHub can be integrated with various tools and services to automate the software development process. This includes continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) tools that help developers build, test, and deploy code more efficiently.
- GitHub hosts many open source projects, which provide opportunities for developers to contribute to popular projects and gain experience collaborating with others. It's a great way to build your skills and network with other developers.
