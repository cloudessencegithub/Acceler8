#  Github Conflicts


## Learning Objectives
- Understand the concepts and principles of Git collaboration

### Estimated Time: 1 hour

## Exercise
These exercises should help you practice your knowledge of Git collaboration. Good luck!

### Instructions
IMPORTANT NOTE: Read all instructions carefully before starting the exercise.

- Create a new repository on GitHub, or use an existing one. Invite a collaborator to the repository.
- Both you and your collaborator should clone the repository to your local machines using git clone <repository URL>.
- Create a new branch in your local repository using git checkout -b <branch-name> and make changes to a file.
- Commit your changes and push them to your branch using git add ., git commit -m "commit message", and git push origin <branch-name>.
- Your collaborator should do the same thing on a separate branch.
- Now both branches have diverged from the main branch, and there is a potential for a conflict.
- To simulate a conflict, have both you and your collaborator edit the same line of code in the same file and commit your changes to your respective branches.

### Submit your work
