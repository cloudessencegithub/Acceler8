# Github Conflicts

## Learning Objectives
To understand the causes of conflicts in GitHub and learn how to resolve them using different strategies and tools available in the platform.
Some key topics that could be covered to achieve this objective are:
Understanding the basics of version control systems and how they work in GitHub
Identifying the common causes of conflicts in collaborative projects, such as merging incompatible changes or editing the same file simultaneously
Learning how to use Git commands and GitHub features to detect and resolve conflicts, such as the pull request review process, merge options, and merge conflict resolution tools
Practicing communication and collaboration skills to prevent conflicts and reach consensus with other contributors
Exploring best practices for managing conflicts in large or complex projects, such as using branching strategies or automated testing.

### Estimated Time: 1 week

## Introduction
A conflict in GitHub occurs when multiple users make changes to the same lines of code in a repository, and those changes cannot be automatically merged by GitHub. This can happen when two or more users edit the same file at the same time, or when one user's changes conflict with another user's changes that were made earlier. Conflicts must be resolved manually by one of the collaborators, usually by reviewing the changes, determining which changes should be kept, and then committing the resolved changes. This process can be done in command line or through the GitHub's web interface.

## Why is it important to know?
GitHub conflicts are a common occurrence when working on collaborative projects using Git. They happen when two or more developers make changes to the same code in different branches or at different times, resulting in conflicts that need to be resolved before the changes can be merged into the main codebase.
Learning how to handle GitHub conflicts is important for several reasons:
It helps to prevent errors and save time: When conflicts are not handled properly, they can cause errors in the code, leading to bugs and even crashes. Resolving conflicts promptly can save time and prevent these issues from occurring.
It promotes teamwork and collaboration: Conflict resolution is a necessary skill for effective collaboration. By learning how to resolve GitHub conflicts, developers can work together more efficiently and avoid misunderstandings or conflicts.
It ensures code quality: By resolving conflicts correctly, developers can ensure that the codebase is consistent and maintainable, which is critical for producing high-quality software.
It is a valuable skill for software development: Knowing how to manage GitHub conflicts is an important skill for any developer, as it is a standard tool used in many development teams and projects.
