# Routing
Network routing is the process of selecting a path across one or more networks. The principles of routing can apply to any type of network, from telephone networks to public transportation. In packet-switching networks, such as the Internet, routing selects the paths for Internet Protocol (IP) packets to travel from their origin to their destination. These Internet routing decisions are made by specialized pieces of network hardware called routers.

## Why it't important to know
Efficient Data Delivery: Routing ensures that data packets are efficiently delivered to their intended destinations. It determines the optimal path for packet transmission based on factors such as network topology, link conditions, and traffic congestion. By dynamically selecting the best available path, routing minimizes delays, maximizes throughput, and optimizes network performance.

Network Connectivity: Routing allows for the interconnection of various networks, enabling communication between devices and systems across different network segments or even across the internet. It establishes end-to-end connectivity and ensures that data can traverse multiple network hops to reach its destination.

Scalability and Expansion: Routing facilitates network scalability by accommodating the growth of networks. As new devices, networks, or subnets are added, routing protocols adapt to include them in the routing table and ensure that data can be properly routed to and from these new components. This scalability feature allows networks to expand and accommodate increased traffic and larger numbers of devices.

Fault Tolerance and Redundancy: Routing protocols can dynamically adjust the routing paths in the event of link failures or network congestion. They can reroute traffic through alternate paths to avoid areas of network disruption, ensuring high availability and minimizing the impact of failures. By providing redundancy and fault tolerance, routing contributes to the resilience and reliability of networks.

Load Balancing: Routing can distribute network traffic across multiple paths, allowing for load balancing. By intelligently distributing data packets across available network links, routing ensures that no single link becomes overwhelmed with traffic. This optimizes resource utilization and prevents bottlenecks, thereby improving network performance and responsiveness.
