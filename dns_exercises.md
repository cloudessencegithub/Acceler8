# DNS Exercises
DNS, or the Domain Name System, translates human readable domain names (for example, www.amazon.com) to machine readable IP addresses (for example, 192.0.2.44).

### Estimated Time: 1hr

## Exercises

1. Configure a DNS server (such as BIND or Windows Server DNS) to host a zone for a domain name of your choice. Create the necessary DNS records, including A records, CNAME records, and MX records. Test the DNS server by performing lookups for the configured domain name and verifying that the correct IP addresses and mail servers are returned.


2. Perform a DNS lookup using the "nslookup" or "dig" command for a domain name of your choice. Analyze the output and identify the authoritative DNS servers for the domain, as well as the IP addresses associated with the domain name.
