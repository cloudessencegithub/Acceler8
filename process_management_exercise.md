- Use the `kill` command to terminate a specific process by its PID. Verify that the process was successfully terminated by checking its status using the `ps` command.
- Use the `nice` command to adjust the priority of a specific process. Verify that the process priority was successfully changed by checking its status using the `ps` command.
- Use the `kill` command to send a signal to a specific process, such as the SIGTERM signal to gracefully terminate the process, or the SIGKILL signal to forcefully terminate the process. Verify that the signal was successfully sent and processed by checking the process status using the `ps` command.
- Use the `at` command to schedule a process to run at a specific time in the future. Verify that the process was successfully scheduled and executed by checking its status using the `ps` command.
