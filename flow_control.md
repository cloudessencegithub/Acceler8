# Flow control Statements
The most commonly used programming construct is conditional execution, or the if
statement. It is used to perform actions only under certain conditions. There are several
variations of if statements for testing various types of conditions.

## Learning Objectives

## Why it's important to know

Learning flow control in Bash is important because it allows you to write more sophisticated and flexible scripts. Flow control statements provide you with the ability to make decisions, iterate over data, and handle different scenarios based on specific conditions. Here are a few reasons why learning flow control in Bash is valuable:

Decision Making: Flow control statements such as if and case allow you to make decisions based on specific conditions or user input. This enables your script to take different paths and execute different actions based on the outcome of those conditions. Decision-making capabilities are crucial for building scripts that handle various scenarios and adapt to different situations.

Looping and Iteration: Bash provides loop constructs like for and while that allow you to iterate over lists of data, files, or perform actions repeatedly until certain conditions are met. Looping is essential for automating repetitive tasks, processing data in bulk, or performing operations on a set of items.

Error Handling and Validation: Flow control statements can help you handle errors, validate input, and perform error-checking in your scripts. You can use conditionals to check for errors or unexpected conditions and handle them gracefully, providing informative messages or taking appropriate actions.

Script Control and Flexibility: By mastering flow control, you gain the ability to control the execution flow of your scripts, allowing you to design more complex logic and handle complex use cases. This includes branching, nested conditionals, and combining flow control statements with other commands and functions to create powerful and flexible scripts.

Script Maintainability: Proper use of flow control improves the readability and maintainability of your scripts. By organizing your code with structured decision-making and looping constructs, you can make your scripts easier to understand, debug, and modify in the future.
