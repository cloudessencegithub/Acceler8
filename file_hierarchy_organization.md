# File system hierarchy and organization

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Understand and describe the file system hierarchy and organization in Linux system
- Understand the purpose and structure of directories, files, and file permissions
- Be able to navigate, manipulate and organize files and directories using command line tools.

### Estimated Time: 2 hours

## Introduction
The file system is the way in which files and directories are organized and stored on a computer. The file system is a hierarchical structure, which means that it is organized in a tree-like structure. The root directory is at the top of the tree and all other directories and files are organized below it. The root directory is represented by a single forward slash (/). The root directory is the parent directory of all other directories and files. The root directory is also known as the root directory or the root directory.

## Why is it important to know?
- Efficient use of resources: Understanding the file system hierarchy helps users to efficiently use the available storage resources by organizing and managing files and directories in a structured manner.
- Improved system security: Knowledge of file permissions and directory structures helps users to secure their data and system by restricting access to unauthorized users or processes.
- Enhanced productivity: Familiarity with the Linux file system organization allows users to quickly and easily locate, modify, and manage files and directories using command line tools, which can significantly increase their productivity.
- Better troubleshooting: Knowledge of the Linux file system hierarchy helps users to identify and troubleshoot issues related to file system errors or disk space usage.
